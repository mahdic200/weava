## What is Weava

Weava is a web framework based on MVC architecture and <a href="https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp">Fiber</a> package. It is inspired by Laravel framework but with different purpose.

## Why is it built

Although there are great packages for golang to make web based APIs , there is still a big lack of architecture and arrangement in golang projects. though , there are various styles of coding among golang programmers. Weava is here to give you arrangement and architecture and help you focus on your ideas and not to be involved in technical issues.
