Why Minimal ?

As a matter of fact , when you dive in to the programming world and it's fantastic environment , as you grow you will find out that **less is more** . what does it even mean ? it means when you start to be ambitious and make your code work perfectly or fully automated , you will be trapped in an infinite loop because every day there is a space and a gap to make your code better and better . don't believe me ? take a look at famous repositories like tensorflow , numpy , pytorch , or even Laravel . trust me , these guys have wasted a lot of time and energy to add some fancy features , like adding ancii characters to make the shell integration a bit prettier , or making everything automated by over-engineering it , but instead of achieving good results , what do they get ? lack of memory safety , unexpected crashes , dropped performance and so on . so ask yourself , is it really worth it to do such a thing ? isn't it just better to focus on making your code to do what it was suppose to do ? the main purpose , the reason that why you got your hands dirty on computer , your spent time and energy , the nights you were awaken ? . so what will happen if we sacrifice a bit amount of time to do some tiny tiny steps that were suppose to be done by the code automatically ? it makes more sense isn't it ? you will have to write less code , less complexity , less pressure on the maintainers and also , the users have more control over what they are using , they can tweak it and customize it in the way they want . so what just happened ? we saved many hours and much time and energy with just sacrificing a bit amount of our time and using a bit of knowledge by doing some small steps which were suppose to be done just AUTOMATICALLY by our code , such as , shell scripts , installers , initializers and any other extra code which does the same .

So here's my answer to you , it doesn't worth it to make something that much complex that does everything by itself . so what would be your role as a programmer on that time ? . you will be meaningless , unworthy , cause a shell script , pre-written buy a bunch of bad-ass programmers does the same that you do :) . I will add complexity to my code , as much as needed to make my code works . and thats my mindset .

Good luck and happy coding !
