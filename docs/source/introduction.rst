Why MVC ?
---------

Me , I mean `mahdic200 <https://github.com/mahdic200>`_ , the owner of this repository am a senior full-stack developer and have worked with many popular frameworks and tools , like NodeJS and Laravel and of course GoFiber . in every back-end project , you can do a lot of things , you can handle everything in any way that you are more comfortable with , but what if things get a bit messy and your project needed development ? you have to make it bigger and more complex . so what are you gonna do ? can you do it in ANYWAY ? . of course not , you need some rules , some architecture and arrangement , to be able to expand your code in a readable and maintainable way .

So if you search a bit , you will find out that MVC is one of the best architectures that you can use in your projects , everything is predefined and you'll not be overwhelmed by various styles of coding . trust me , it's much better to limit your mind and give it a way to think :) .

And to get your hands dirty , I'll invite you to read the next section !
